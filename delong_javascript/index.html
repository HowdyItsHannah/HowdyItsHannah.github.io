  document.getElementById("textToChange").innerHTML="If you are up for a little bit of a challenge to make a treat with sweet whipped cream and fresh fruit baked with a crispy outside and soft marshmallowy inside - this recipe is for you. (Guess what? These are vegan too). <br> <span> Ingredients:</span> 6 tbsp. of chickpea brine (from a 15 oz. can of chickpeas), 1/4 tsp. of cream of tartar, 1/2 c. of sugar, 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract, some jam or whipped coconut cream for the filling, and berries or chopped nuts for the topping. For the filling, you'll need 2 cans of full-fat coconut milk and 2 tsp. of vanilla extract.<br><span>  Step 1:</span> Preheat your oven to 225 degrees F. <br> <span> Step 2:</span> In a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the chickpea brine and cream of tartar on medium for 5 minutes. Continue beating, and add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat for 10 minutes more until medium-stiff, glossy peaks form. Beat in the vanilla.<br> <span> Step 3:</span> On a large parchment-lined baking sheet, spoon 8 large dollops of meringue (3 inches each), pressing lightly in the center to form an indent for filling. <br> <span> Step 4:</span> Bake for 1 hour. Turn off the oven; let stand in the oven for 1 hour. Cool completely. <br> <span> Step 5: </span> Meanwhile, make the Whipped Coconut Cream: After refrigerating the coconut milk overnight (avoid shaking cans so as to let cream rise to the top undisturbed), scoop the coconut cream from the cans, reserving liquid for another use. Add to the large mixing bowl. Add the vanilla extract. With the mixer with the whisk attachment on high speed, beat until stiff peaks form. <br> <span> Step 6: </span>To serve, fill with jam or Whipped Coconut Cream; top with berries or nuts. Unfilled pavlovas can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature for up to 1 week. <br><span> (Recipe and photo from the Good Housekeeping.com)</span>";

Spoon into eight 4-ounce ramekins.
